This Dockerfile will build a Docker image based on the official Node.js 14 image, copy your app's package.json and package-lock.json files into the image, install the app's dependencies, copy the rest of the app's files into the image, and then start the app with the npm start command.

Here's a brief README.md to go along with it:

Running a Node.js and Express app with Docker
This is an example docker-compose.yml file and Dockerfile for running a Node.js and Express app with Docker.

Prerequisites
Docker
Node.js and npm (only needed to build the app)
Getting started
Clone this repository
cd into the repository
Build the Docker image: docker-compose build
Start the Docker container: docker-compose up
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000
That's it! Your Node.js and Express app should now be running in a Docker container.
